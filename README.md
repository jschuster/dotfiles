# My dotfiles and basic macOS shell setup

Basically i use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) as my terminal and [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh) to manage the zsh settings.

This repo should make it easier for me to use my setup on multiple Macs and keep it consistent.

You may find some ideas useful, so feel free to copy parts or all of it.
To do this, you can fork the entire repo or just select some ideas.

In my [iterm2setup](https://github.com/jschuster/iterm2setup) repo you will find a tutorial on how to set up iTerm2.

## Installation
For my future me and you I wrote Makefiles in the corresponding subfolders.

So basically all you need to do is

* checkout this repo somehwere on your Mac (as mentioned, you can fork it beforehand so you can have a custom setup)
* navigate into a subfolder e.g. iterm2 and execute 
    ```
    make install
    ```
