# Joachim Schuster's dotfiles and basic Mac Setup

This repo provides the basic setup of my Mac workstation.

* `macos` contains a script to set my preferences for the system, dock, finder etc.
* `ìterm2` contains a makefile for setting up my iTerm custom theme etc.
* `oh-my-zsh` contains a makefile to install and keep the zsh config in sync across all workstations.


You may find some ideas useful, so feel free to copy parts or all of them.
To do this, you can fork the entire repo or select just a few ideas.

In my [iterm2setup](https://github.com/jschuster/iterm2setup) repo you will find a tutorial on how to set up iTerm2.
